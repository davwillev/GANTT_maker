# GANTT_maker

Run the R script in RStudio to create a coloured GANTT chart

Ensure that tasks are in their correct chronological order (based on start date). If not, they will be re-ordered but may not be in the preferred order if more than one task has the same start date

The axes will rescale depending on the number of tasks and the largest end date.
